# Modern Big Data Candidate Questions

## General Big Data Concepts

### What is Big Data, and why is it important?
Explain what Big Data refers to and discuss how businesses leverage massive amounts of data for decision-making, operational efficiency, and strategic goals.

### What are the key challenges in managing Big Data?
Discuss the challenges related to scalability, data quality, processing speed, integration of diverse data sources, data security, and real-time processing.

### Can you explain the differences between batch processing and real-time (stream) processing?
Compare these two processing paradigms and give examples of tools or frameworks used for each (e.g., Spark for batch, Flink/Kafka for streaming).

### What are the most important components in a modern data stack?
Discuss modern data architecture components, including data lakes, data warehouses, data pipelines, ETL/ELT, and tools like Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.

## Modern Data Transformation and Processing Frameworks

### What is Apache Spark, and how does it differ from Hadoop MapReduce?
Explain how Spark improves upon MapReduce, focusing on in-memory processing, flexibility in APIs (e.g., support for Scala, Java, Python, R), and its ecosystem (MLlib, Spark SQL, etc.).

### What are some use cases for Apache Flink or similar stream processing frameworks?
Discuss where Flink or other real-time streaming frameworks (like Kafka Streams) are useful, e.g., for event-driven architectures, IoT data processing, and fraud detection.

### How would you implement a data pipeline using a combination of Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, and a data warehouse like Snowflake?
Walk through the steps of setting up a data pipeline with real-time data ingestion via Kafka, processing in Spark, and then persisting the results into Snowflake or a similar data warehouse for querying.

### What are the advantages of using cloud-native big data services like AWS Glue, Google Dataflow, or Azure Data Factory?
Explain how these services enable serverless data processing, scale-out capabilities, and support for ETL/ELT operations with minimal operational overhead.

## Data Storage Technologies

### What is a Data Lake, and how does it differ from a Data Warehouse?
Explain the concept of a data lake, how it stores raw, unstructured data, and compare it with the structured nature of a data warehouse.

### What is Delta Lake, and how does it improve upon traditional data lakes?
Describe how Delta Lake adds ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and time travel capabilities to data lakes, making them more suitable for enterprise data management.

### How would you design a data storage architecture for a company handling both structured and unstructured data?
Discuss how to organize structured data (e.g., in relational databases like Snowflake or Redshift) and unstructured data (e.g., in a data lake using S3 or Hadoop HDFS).

### What are your thoughts on using cloud-based data warehouses like Snowflake or BigQuery vs. on-prem solutions like Hadoop?
Explain the trade-offs between cloud-based solutions and traditional on-premise deployments in terms of scalability, cost, and ease of use.

## Data Ingestion and Streaming

### How would you set up a data streaming architecture using Apache Kafka?
Discuss Kafkaâ€™s role as a distributed log for handling high-throughput, low-latency data streams, and walk through the setup of producers, consumers, and topics.

### How would you implement real-time data ingestion into a data lake using Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis?
Walk through a use case for ingesting real-time data from various sources (IoT devices, user interactions, etc.) into a data lake (e.g., using AWS Kinesis Firehose or Kafka to S3).

### What are the benefits of using Apache Pulsar over Apache Kafka for data streaming?
Discuss some of the newer capabilities in Pulsar, such as multi-tenancy, geo-replication, and event storage/streaming unification.

---

## Cloud and Serverless Data Processing

### What is the role of serverless in Big Data, and what are some examples of serverless data processing?
Discuss how serverless technologies like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions can be used in a Big Data ecosystem, e.g., for ETL, event-driven architectures, and auto-scaling.

### Can you describe a serverless data processing pipeline using AWS Glue or Databricks?
Walk through a pipeline that uses serverless technologies to ingest data, transform it, and load it into a storage system, emphasizing the benefits of a serverless architecture (e.g., ease of scaling and cost-efficiency).

### How do you manage data governance and security in a serverless environment?
Discuss best practices for securing data in transit and at rest, monitoring data access, and ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA in a serverless ecosystem.

---

## Data Governance and Compliance

### What tools and techniques do you use for data governance in Big Data platforms?
Discuss modern tools like Apache Atlas, AWS Lake Formation, or Collibra, and explain how they assist in managing metadata, tracking lineage, and ensuring compliance.

### How do you ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance when working with large datasets?
Discuss approaches for managing sensitive data, ensuring consent for data usage, and implementing data anonymization, encryption, and secure data deletion.

---

## Machine Learning and Data Science

### How do you integrate machine learning models into a data pipeline?
Walk through an end-to-end ML pipeline, including data ingestion, feature engineering, model training using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and serving the model in real-time.

### What is the difference between batch and real-time inference in machine learning?
Compare how batch inference works (processing large volumes of data at once) versus real-time inference (making predictions for each incoming data point immediately).

### How would you scale a machine learning model to work with streaming data?
Discuss techniques for handling real-time predictions in a streaming environment using tools like Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, or TensorFlow Serving.

### How do you manage model lifecycle and versioning in a production environment?
Discuss tools like MLflow or Kubernetes, as well as strategies for tracking experiments, model versioning, deployment, and monitoring model performance in production.
